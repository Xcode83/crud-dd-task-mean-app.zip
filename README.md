Overview

This project is a fully containerized MEAN stack application that performs basic CRUD operations using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. The application is deployed on an Ubuntu EC2 instance and served via Nginx reverse proxy on port 80. CI/CD is implemented using GitHub Actions to automate image building, pushing, and deployment on changes.

Architecture
Components Used

Frontend: Angular application

Backend: Node.js + Express REST API

Database: MongoDB (Docker container)

Reverse Proxy: Nginx

Infrastructure: Ubuntu EC2 instance

Container Platform: Docker + Docker Compose

CI/CD: GitHub Actions & Docker Hub registry

Deployment Details
1. Local Deployment
docker compose up -d


Open in browser:

http://localhost/

2. Cloud Deployment (AWS EC2)
Requirements

Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance

Ports allowed:

22/tcp for SSH

80/tcp for HTTP

Commands Used on EC2
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
exit


Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
cd repo
docker compose up -d

Application Access
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/

CI/CD Workflow

A GitHub Actions pipeline runs automatically on every commit pushed to main.

Pipeline stages:

Checkout latest source code

Build Docker images for frontend and backend

Push images to Docker Hub

SSH into EC2

Pull latest code and images

Restart containers via Docker Compose

You only update code → the deployment updates automatically.

Pipeline file:

.github/workflows/cicd.yml

Docker Commands Used
Build & Push images (handled automatically by CI/CD)
docker build -t <user>/mean-backend:latest backend/
docker build -t <user>/mean-frontend:latest frontend/
docker push <user>/mean-backend:latest
docker push <user>/mean-frontend:latest
